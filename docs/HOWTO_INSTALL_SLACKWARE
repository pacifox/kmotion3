*************************** SLACKWARE : AUTO INSTALL ******************************

This is the only distro that I have not personally installed kmotion on, if the
following fails please let me know so I can correct this HOWTO.

In Slackware 13.1, Apache 2.2.15 and Python 2.6.4 are included in the disto and 
installed by default. Anyway, if you have an embedded system, you can manually 
install them with the Slackware Package Manager (pkgtool) in this way 
(all the packages are named PACKAGE-ver.subver-arch.txz or *.tgz for older versions):

sudo installpkg httpd-2.2.15-x86_64-1.txz           
(you can find it in /slackware/n/ in the slackware 
iso or in an online slackware repository)

sudo installpkg python-2.6.4-x86_64-1.txz           
(you can find it in /slackware/d/ in the slackware iso or in an online slackware 
repository)

sudo installpkg mod_python-3.3.1-x86_64-1_SBo.txz   
(not included in a slackware distro, you have to download all the stuff from 
http://slackbuilds.org/repository/13.1/network/mod_python/ and build with the 
slackbuild tool - a slackware user "should" be albe to do this!)

sudo installpkg motion-3.2.12-x86_64-1_SBo.txz      
(same as above, download from http://slackbuilds.org/repository/13.1/system/motion/)

cd to the kmotion directory ...

sudo ./install.py 
kmotion start

Slackware does not understand the cron @reboot directive so after a restart 
kmotion will not be restarted. A workaround is to edit "/etc/rc.d/rc.local" and
add the line ...

su -c "/usr/local/bin/kmotion start" <user that kmotion is to be run as>

(thanks to koen for supplying this tip)

and if you want to uninstall

sudo ./uninstall.py
